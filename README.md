## About the project

The application makes a call to a weather API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Currently the project is able to fetch the temperature data, and recommend clothing. The user can also see preview images of the item cards.

The User can add and delete personal clothing items, and set the temperature to associate them with!

Future features includes:
-Customizing the User Avatar
-Changing the weather card based on time of day and temperature
-Fetch the user's locale instead of a pre-fixed coordinate
-More!
